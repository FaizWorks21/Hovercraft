##  Overview
A lightweight, portable amphibious hovercraft built for emergency response and multi-terrain mobility.  
It provides access to environments where **boats, drones & wheeled robots fail**, such as:

- Disaster response & emergency deployment  
- Flooded or debris-blocked areas  
- Indoor & under-debris surveillance where drones cannot fly  
- Delivery of medical supplies in difficult terrain  
- Military forward-recon applications & rescue planning  

---

##  Key Features
- Multi-surface mobility: **water, debris, sand, mud, rubble, indoor floors**
- **Modular payload system** for camera, sensors & delivery mechanism
- **Compact & safe** — no exposed propellers
- Works in **narrow spaces & confined rescue environments**
- **Portable & rapidly deployable**
- Can support **surveillance + emergency supply delivery**

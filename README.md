## 📌 Overview

During floods, building collapse, shallow-water disasters and debris-filled zones, **traditional rescue tools fail**:

- Boats cannot move in **shallow / debris** water  
- Drones struggle **indoors, under rubble or bad weather**  
- Wheeled robots get stuck in **mud, sand, rubble**  
- Human entry is **slow and high-risk**

This project presents a **multi-terrain hovercraft** that can glide over:

> 🌊 Water · 🪵 Debris · 🏜 Sand · 🧱 Rubble · 🧊 Frozen surfaces · 🏚 Indoor floors  

It is designed to support **rescue scouting, surveillance, under-debris inspection, and emergency delivery**.
